                I started off by making a sketch in fusion of a heart and four circles to serve as button holes. I extruded the heart 10 mm, which I probably should've scaled down by almost half since the buttons ended up very large. I copied the heart and scaled it down to cut into the larger one in order to get a traditional button look. Then I placed each button hole 2.5 mm apart from each other in a square and extruded them to cut fully into both hearts.

                After heating it up and unloading black filament from the 3-D printer, I loaded in pink filament and started my print of 5 buttons, which took about an hour and a half.

                I forgot to take pictures of the machine while it was printing, but my buttons came out successfully. There was some filament in the button holes, but I was able to either break it or fit my needle through it.

                I used a Butterick pattern to create skirt C, and I proceeded to cut out the required pattern pieces from a silk blend fabric.

              My second digital fabrication use was my own sewing machine since the embroidery machine was out of commission when I wanted to use it. I did not take many pictures of the machine sewing process because I get so engrossed in the task that I sometimes forget to eat. The sewing process was very easy as I had a pattern with simple instructions and visuals to follow, and my machine has an automatic threader.

              Next, I had to position the buttons in both a practical but also aesthetic way. I would've liked to put them in a straight line, but I wanted to make sure they would do their task in keeping the fabric up.

                I hand sewed the buttons on, and since they were flat, I had to create a shank with the thread.

              The loops were made with a white elastic cord and were also hand sewed in. I sewed them flush against the fabric and was able to adjust them before tying off the end into a neat knot to keep it in place.
